# Sales Predictions
This is a Jupiter Notebook for predicting sales using machine learning algorithms. The notebook contains all the necessary code and explanations to predict sales based on various input variables.

## Getting Started
To get started with this notebook, you will need to have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn libraries
Once you have all the necessary software installed, you can open the sales_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the results.

## Data
The data used in this notebook is a sample dataset of sales data containing various input variables such as Item MPR, Item Type, etc. The dataset can be found in the data folder.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building a machine learning model to predict sales, we first explore the data and analyze the relationships between the input variables and the target variable (Item Outlet Sales). This section includes visualizations and statistical analysis to help us understand the data.

## Data Preprocessing
In this section, we prepare the data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the data. We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our model.

## Machine Learning Model
We train a machine learning model to predict sales based on the input variables. We compare the performance of Linear Regression, and Tree Regression, and choose the best one based on their accuracy and applicability.

## Model Evaluation
Finally, we evaluate the performance of our chosen machine learning model using various performance metrics, including R-squared, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a comprehensive guide to predicting sales using machine learning algorithms. By following the steps outlined in this notebook, you can build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict sales based on various input variables.
